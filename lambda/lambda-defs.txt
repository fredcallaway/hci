#Actions

#make1 = draw; it creates a new object and puts it on the screen
define make1: Lx[draw(x)]

#make2 modifies the parameters of an existing object on the screen
define make2: LxLP[P(x)]

#move modifies the parameters of an existing object on the screen
define move: LxLP[P(x)]

#delete/remove/erase all move an item from the on-screen list to the off-screen list
define delete: Lx[hide(x)]
define remove: Lx[hide(x)]
define erase: Lx[hide(x)]

#clear removes all items from the on-screen and off-screen lists and resets the program to its starting state
define clear: clear

#'undo' reverts the world to the state it was in prior to the instruction stored in 'that'
define undo: Lp[undo(p)]

#'again' runs the instruction stored in 'that' again; 'again' should not update 'that'
#The meaning of 'copy' is semantically equivalent in our world to the meaning of 'again'
define copy: Lp[again(p)]
define again: Lp[again(p)]
# FRED: this meaning of copy is unintuitve to me. i think of copy as taking a shape as argument
#       not an action, e.g. 'copy the blue square'

#Directional Statements

#Ex: make1 a circle on the left side of the screen
define on-the-left-side-of-the-screen: Lx[large-left-displacement(x)]

#Ex: move it left
define left: Lx[small-left-displacement(x)]

#Ex: move the circle to the left of the square
define to-the-left-of: LxLy[left(x,y)]

#Function Words

define a: LP[Gx(P(x))]
define the: LP[Ix(P(x))]

#'it' is the Python variable that contains the identity of the last updated element
define it: it

#'them' is the Python variable that contains the identity of the most recently updated elements
define them: them

#that: for use with undo and copy
#Ex: 'undo that'
define that: that

#'another' is semantically equivalent in our world to 'a'
#Ex: 'make1 another one1'
define another: LP[Gx(P(x))]

#one1: for use with make1
#Ex: 'make1 a blue one' (of whatever shape was most recently made)
#one1 is equal to the value of it.shape in Python 
#it.shape is the shape parameter of the object currently stored in 'it'
#it.shape(x) should operate like square(x) when it.shape = square
#it.shape is represented here as it-shape due to LC syntax restrictions
#Version of one1 that only preserves shape info in new object
#Draw a big blue square. Make a red one. => A red square. (Not big.)
#define one1: Lx[itShape(x)]
#Version of one1 that preserves all unchanged parameters in new object
#Draw a big blue square. Make a red one. => A big red square. (Preserves bigness.)
define one1: Lx[itParameters(x)]
# FRED: for python, all function names must contain only letters numbers and underscores
#       also, try to keep all but one possible definitions commented out so LC works

#one2: for use with make2
#Ex: 'make2 the blue one green'
define one2: LP.P

#ones: for use with make2
#Ex: 'make2 the blue ones green'
#ones iterates over the predicate in P to determine all of the entities in the on-screen list that satisfy P
define ones: Lx[iterate(x)]
# FRED: this structure won't work in python. i suggest making another operator
# that behaves almost like iota but returns all shapes that match the condition

#An 'and' for all occasions
define and-e: LxLy[x & y]
define and-t: LpLq[p & q]
define and-et: LPLQLx[P(x) & Q(x)]
# FRED: i can't get this to work. maybe it is because i don't have gamma defined

#Ex: 'do that again'
define do: Lp.p

#Dummy function to extract result for Plop
# this line is necessary to work with python
define result: Lp[result(p)]
